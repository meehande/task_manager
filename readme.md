## **Task Manager**

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage and execute "tasks." These tasks simulate long-running operations that can be started, monitored, paused, resumed, or cancelled, and includes:

- A basic frontend UI for task management.
- A backend API to process and track tasks.
- A Dockerised setup to allow easy deployment and execution.
- The ability to run both frontend and backend locally with minimal setup.

### Instructions

In order to run the application, you will need to run the backend and frontend services. The frontend is configured to point to the backend running locally as is. Both can be run directly with python (backend) or npm (frontend), or a docker image can be built and docker used to run them.


Instructions on setting up and running the backend are available [here](./backend/README.md).

Instructions on setting up and running the frontend are available [here](./frontend/README.md)
